isp_param_parser

This tool is used to help parse ia_binary_data generated by isp_run.

How to build:
1. Install python and mako by: sudo apt-get install python python-mako
2. Copy required pal type defintion header ia_pal_types_isp.h, ia_pal_types_isp_ids_autogen.h and
   ia_pal_types_isp_parameters_autogen.h which is located in libmfldadvci/ia_imaging/include/
   to current folder You can get libmfldadvci from repo code base or by:
   git clone ssh://icggerrit.ir.intel.com:29418/vied-viedandr-libmfldadvci
3. ./AutoGen.py
4. make -j -B
5. Executable file isp_param_parser will be created

How to use:
Just run as a normal executable file, if no parameters provided, the default file name dump.bin in current folder
will be used for parsing. It can take arbitrary number of input files as its parameters, and result will be saved
into {input_file}.out

How to get the ia_binary_data:
1. export cameraDump=512
2. export cameraDumpPath="xxxx"
3. run libcamhal_test
If step 2 not executed, default dump path /tmp/ will be used.
