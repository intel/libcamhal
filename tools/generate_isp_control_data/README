isp_ctrl_data_gen.py is used to generate ISP control data or LTM tuning data for testing from a text file.

Prerequisites:
python and mako, install them by: sudo apt-get install python python-mako

Step to run:
1. Copy HAL API file: IspControl.h and AlgoTuning.h to current folder.
2. Update the ISP control data, please refer to file: sample_isp_control
3. Update the LTM tuning data, please refer to file: sample_ltm_tuning
3. Execute ./isp_ctrl_data_gen.py [ltm_tuning=ltm_tuning_data_file] [isp_control_data_file]
   At least one of ltm_tuning_data_file or isp_control_data_file MUST be provided.
   For ltm_tuning_data_file, a prefix "ltm_tuning=" MUST be added, or other arguments not started with
   "ltm_tuning=" will be treated as ISP control data file.
   ltm_tuning_data_file and isp_control_data_file can be parsed at same time.

4. The output file will be named as *.bin which appends ".bin" after the data file.

The tool can be used on the DUT as well, but you need to install python-mako rpm manually before step 3 above:
1. wget ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/opensuse/distribution/13.2/repo/oss/suse/noarch/python-Mako-1.0.0-3.1.4.noarch.rpm
2. sudo rpm -ivh --nodeps python-Mako-1.0.0-3.1.4.noarch.rpm
